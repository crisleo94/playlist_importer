# Index
The main idea behind this python script is to achieve a sort of automation related to exporting/importing playlists in YoutubeMusic or Spotify, for example if I have a 500 songs in a Spotify playlist and want that same playlist in my Youtube, I won't start adding the song one by one, so this is why this script was born

# Ideas
Change the implementation to a `Flask` API in order to consume it from a frontend in React/Angular

# Tasks
- [x] Create Spotify Application
